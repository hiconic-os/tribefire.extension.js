/**
 * This is a little tricky - not every js library artifact needs to be an asset, so let's explain what it is and when it should be an asset.
 * <p>
 * Js library artifact is an artifact which contains a <code>js.zip</code> part.
 * <p>
 * From this perspective, we can package any 3rd party JavaScript library as our js library artifact, as well as every model is also such an artifact.
 * <p>
 * When doing a setup, for every js library artifact, the content of it's <code>zip</code> is extracted into a folder called
 * <code>${groupId}.${artifactId}-${version}~</code> inside a target folder (e.g. <code>tribefire-services/context/js-libraries</code>).
 * <p>
 * Now, what is a JsLibrary asset? Since the setup process is driven by {@link PlatformAsset} assets, i.e. it resolves all the assets starting from a
 * given terminal artifact, and then processes each asset according to it's {@link PlatformAssetNature nature}, we need an asset that marks a js
 * library artifact. Thus a setup process knows that artifact and all it's js dependencies need to have their <code>js.zip</code> parts processed.
